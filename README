This is a darkish scheme with various cold colors of which most are green/blue.

Recommend to install vimscript #4293 and vimscript #1640 to support STL and C++11.

Note that I only defined gui colors and the term colors were automatically converted to. So probably you need vimscript #2682 or something else to get better performance in terminal.

Note2: I failed to make this scheme compatible with win32 vim terminal.
